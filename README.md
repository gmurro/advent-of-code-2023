## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023 challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Each day's solutions are organized in separate folders, and each part of the challenge has its own Python script.

## Repository Structure
- `day-01/`: Contains the solutions for Day 1.
  - `input.txt`: Input file for the day.
  - `part-1/`: Folder for the first part of the challenge.
    - `solution.py`: Python script for the solution.
  - `part-2/`: Folder for the second part of the challenge.
    - `solution.py`: Python script for the solution.
- `day-02/`: ...
- ...
- `day-25/`: ...

## Running the Solutions
To run a solution, navigate to the corresponding day and part folder and execute the Python script. For example:
```bash
cd day-01/part-1/
python solution.py
```

## Explanation of Solution Structure
- Each solution script is written in Python.
- The `input.txt` file contains the input data for the puzzle of respective day.
- The solutions are designed to be modular and well-commented for clarity.
